    """
    A TCP proxy, running as a context manager.

    The proxy listens for connections on a socket, and for each incoming
    connection creates a new outgoing connection to a pre-configured upstream
    host and port number. It then forwards data back and forth between the two
    sockets.

    The configured upstream can be modified after instantiation by calling
    `set_upstream`. The change only affects future connections, not existing
    established ones. In our use case, the previous upstream service is shut
    down, which closes these established connectionsa anyway.

    This is used to provide a stable hostname and port number for tests to use,
    even as the cchost process is restarted and assigned a different port number.
