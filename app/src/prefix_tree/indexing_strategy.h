  /**
   * An indexing strategy over the ledger that keeps the latest entry for a
   * given issuer and claim in a prefix tree. The root of the prefix tree itself
   * gets committed to the ledger, producing a typical CCF receipt. From the
   * prefix tree receipt and an inclusion proof, a "read receipt" can be
   * derived, providing cryptographic evidence about what the latest claim for a
   * given issuer and claim is.
   *
   * The indexing strategy works by hooking up into CCF and getting notified any
   * time a new transaction is globally committed to the ledger.
   *
   * When a claim is submitted to SCITT, it is written to the ledger and is
   * eventually committed globally (barring any leadership election or
   * conflicting writes). When this happens, a reference to the claim is added
   * to a queue of pending entries, waiting to be inserted to the prefix tree.
   *
   * An external trigger can start the flushing process, in which an updated
   * prefix tree root hash is computed and written to the ledger. The actual
   * in-memory prefix tree is not modified yet, as the ledger transaction could
   * still fail. Only once the indexing strategy witnesses the root hash having
   * been globally committed does it update the prefix tree.
   *
   * If a new node joins the network, or a disaster recovery is performed, the
   * entire ledger must be replayed in order to reconstruct the indexing
   * strategy's state. Eventually, we should add a snapshotting mechanism by
   * serializing the prefix tree to disk.
   *
   * This class performs synchronization internally, and is safe to call
   * concurrently.
